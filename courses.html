                    technology systems. Students acquire practical experience using market-leading object-relational
                    database management systems like Oracle and MySQL. Students obtain hands-on experience with advanced
                    engineering modeling tools along with SQL, SQL scripts and programming with Oracle's PL/SQL blocks.
                    Database concepts covered include advanced SQL, case structures, rollup and cube operations,
                    metadata manipulation, data storage and retrieval, security and transaction control and data

                <p>Operating systems form the backbone of information technology systems coordinating the interaction
                    between hardware and software. Students explore the basic concepts and components of Operating
                    Systems (OS), and how they function and interact with hardware and software components. Students
                    examine the details of operating system structures, process management, storage management,
                    installation, configuration, and administration both in theory and through practical assignments
                    based on the GNU/Linux operating system. Lab work is designed to implement the theory by developing
                    skills using the powerful GNU/Linux command-line tools and utilities.</p>

                <p>The study of algebraic and transcendental functions is an essential prerequisite to Calculus.
                    Students manipulate algebraic expressions, solve algebraic equations and linear systems and learn
                    the properties of and graph algebraic and transcendental functions. Students investigate computer
                    number systems in addition to Boolean algebra and logic to help solve problems involving computer
                    systems. Students also study the addition and subtraction of vectors using vector components.
                    Delivered in a modular format, this course is equivalent to the completion of all of the following
                    math modules MAT8100 - A, B, C, D, E, F, and L.</p>
